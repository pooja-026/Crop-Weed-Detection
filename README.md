# Crop-Weed-Detection
The project aims to develop a comprehensive weed and crop detection system for agricultural fields. Leveraging machine learning and image processing techniques, the system will accurately identify and classify weeds and crops in images uploaded by users. The web application will provide a user-friendly interface for farmers to easily upload images and view the detection results, enabling them to make informed decisions about weed and crop management. Additionally, the system will include educational content about different types of weeds and crops to enhance farmers' understanding and facilitate better field management practices.
