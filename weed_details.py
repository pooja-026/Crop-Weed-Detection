    st.write("Weeds posseses many growth characteristics and adaptations which enable them to exploit successfully the numerous ecological niches left unocccupied by crop cultures. Weeds compete with themselves and with crop plant. Among the more important adoptations relevent to competitive advantage are properly synchronized germination, rapid establishment and growth of seedlings, tolerance to shading effects by the crop or by other weeds at the time of establishment, quick response to available soil moisture and nutrients, adaptation to the most severe climatic situations of the habitat, adaptations to the edaphic regime, relative immunity to post seeding soil disturbance, practices and resistance to herbicides that are used")

    st.write("1. Competition for Nutrients:")
    st.write("Weeds usually absorb mineral nutrients faster than many crop plants and accumulate them in their tissues in relatively larger amounts.")
    st.write("2. Competition for moisture:")
    st.write("In general, for producing equal amounts of dry matter, weeds transpire more water than do most of our crop plants. It becomes increasingly critical with increasing soil moisture stress, as found in arid and semi-arid areas.")
    st.write("3. Competition for light")
    st.write("1.It may commence very early in the cop season if a dense weed growth smothers the crop seedlings.")
    st.write("2.It becomes important element of crop-weed competition when moisture and nutrients are plentiful.")
    st.write("3.In dry land agriculture in years of normal rainfall the crop-weed competition is limited to nitrogen and light.")
    st.write("4.Unlike competition for nutrients and moisture once weeds shade a crop plant, increased light intensity cannot benefit it.")

    st.write("1.Annual Weeds: Complete their lifecycle within a single growing season, germinating from seeds, growing, flowering, setting seeds, and dying within one year.")
